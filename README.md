# Student Management System in Python..!!


Hi! We built a **Student Management System** in Python as part of my learning journey. It’s a **menu-driven program** to manage student records like **roll number, name, course, and marks**.


## Features..
- Add, View, Search, Update & Delete student records  
- Input validation & duplicate roll number prevention  
- File-based storage for permanent data  

## How to Run??
1. Make sure Python is installed.  
2. Navigate to the project folder in terminal.  
3. Run the program:  
4. Follow the menu to manage students  


## What I Learned..
- Python basics: loops, functions, and conditionals  
- File handling for persistent data  
- Input validation & data integrity  


This beginner-friendly project helped me practice **real-world CRUD operations** in Python.  
Feedback and suggestions are always  welcome!
